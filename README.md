#### Custom User validation with Camera Capture

In the homepage the user will be asked to give camera permission. If allowed the camera will open up and show the view from the camera. A square shape will randomly move around. Whenever user captures image it will validate the user with a custom captcha. If user fails to validate, the user will be blocked to use the app for certain amount of time. If he fails more than 5 times he will be blocked forever.
